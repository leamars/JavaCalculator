JavaCalculator
==============

A (currently incomplete) calculator made in Java

It does simple computation with the operators +, -, * and /.
As numbers it can take multiple diget integers.

It currently can not do proper order of opertions;

Things to fiddle with:
* add order of operation functionality
* add doubles support
* add negative number support
